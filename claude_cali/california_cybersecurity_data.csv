CDT,https://cdt.ca.gov/services/security/,Security Services - CDT Services,"CDT Security Services On this page Description Infrastructure Consulting Rates Request Service Description CDT maintains an extensive security program that includes physical facility access control 24 hours per day, 7 days per week as well as event management and audit, intrusion protection, virus protection, vulnerability scanning, and numerous other deterrent and detection methods. To provide assurance of its commitment to security, CDT periodically engages information technology security-certified consultants to conduct third-party vulnerability assessments, security testing, and compliance to industry standards. This process assures the security procedures and practices used by CDT to protect systems from potentially malicious activities. Additionally, this effort tests CDT intrusion detection processes in order to identify opportunities to further reinforce their effectiveness. To obtain additional information about the CDT security, please contact your Account Lead to schedule a confidential discussion. Infrastructure CDT performs various infrastructure vulnerability and protection tasks to ensure that systems housed at the data centers are as safe and secure from unauthorized access attempts as possible. CDT believes that securing the infrastructure is just as important as securing the network. This provides a secure foundation on which customer applications may run. For the protection of CDT and its customers, the particulars of the CDT security program are withheld. To obtain information about the CDT security, please contact your Account Lead to schedule a confidential discussion. The items listed below include but are not limited to the methods in which CDT secures its infrastructure assets: Patching  In a proactive effort to mitigate the risk of attack on the hosted project, CDT follows a regular schedule for patching its systems. Depending on the system hardware, application, and project requirements, the patching frequency will fall under timeframes dependent upon the customer andor CDT requirements. CDT customers will agree upon pre-determined timeframes for which the system can be placed off-line for the patching process to commence if necessary. Risk Auditing  Reporting  CDT performs regularly scheduled risk assessments on its network to assess security-related risks from internal and external threats to its information assets. These assessments do not interrupt the day-to-day operations of its customers. Reports of these risk assessments can be shared with CDT customers if the audit reports a risk on said customers system. Vulnerability Scanning  CDT follows a vulnerability management plan which enables proactive detection and remediation of security vulnerabilities. This is accomplished by employing tools and processes capable of detection and determining various types of vulnerabilities associated with a potential attack or compromise. CDT manages processes that actively identify vulnerabilities, determine the risk the vulnerability poses, and ensures the vulnerability cannot be exploited to harm its customers. Intrusion Protection  CDT employs Intrusion Protection at the Internet border, at the data center borders, and at critical other points in the infrastructure. This provides significant protection against both incoming and outgoing communications that may be of a malicious nature. Network Segmentation  CDT also employs a strongly tiered and segmented network architecture that isolates functions that are allowed to communicate with each other. CDT employs a strong policy-based and change controlled process to determine what communications are allowed to occur within the CDT infrastructure.

CDT,https://cdt.ca.gov/newsroom/2025/06/how-california-is-centralizing-public-sector-cybersecurity/,How California is Centralizing Public Sector Cybersecurity - Newsroom,"Newsroom Back to Newsroom home June 2, 2025 How California is Centralizing Public Sector Cybersecurity Why it Matters: Cyber threats dont discriminate. From large state agencies to small-town departments, every public entity is a potential target. However, for many local governments the necessary staffing, infrastructure, and expertise needed to protect their information assets and data is out of reach. The stakes are high, which is why Californias Security Operations Center as a Service (SOCaaS) is delivering around-the-clock security and protection to public entities across the state. SACRAMENTO, Calif.  The California Department of Technologys Office of Information Security (OIS) continually assesses Californias public sector cybersecurity maturity and then aligns Statewide security controls accordingly to fill the void. While some state entities had established appropriate security measures, others may not be able to maintain their security operations defenses fast enough. Building and maintaining a traditional, full-time security operations center can cost well more than 2 million annually. Even outsourcing could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars each year, placing comprehensive cybersecurity well beyond the reach of resources constrained organizations. Expenses for infrastructure, licensing, and log retention is costly. Factoring in the cost of integrating threat detection and maintaining compliance with state and federal regulations often meant smaller government organizations had to do with outdated and patch-work security that left gaps in essential services and put public data at risk. California wasnt the only state confronting these issues. Other states were also working to improve cybersecurity for their public partners. Some launched endpoint detection programs for local governments, offering monitoring tools through partnerships with industry. Others invested in outsourcing security operations or created dedicated cyber task forces to respond to threats. While these programs were making progress, they were limited in scope, serving only select entities or requiring significant technical overhead from those they aimed to help. Californias response took a holistic approach by creating a nationally leading model that is scalable, equitable and efficient. Instead of expecting each public partner to create its own cybersecurity program, the state centralized the security effort. The result was the SOCaaSa cloud-native, fully managed cybersecurity service delivering 247365 monitoring, threat detection, and incident response to all participating public sector subscribers. The service integrates with the California Cybersecurity Integration Center (Cal-CSIC) for coordinated threat intelligence sharing, incident response and recovery. Detection capabilities have grown dramatically from 110 adversarial tactics and techniques to more than 1,000 covering all 14 major attack tactics and 90 of attack techniques commonly observed throughout the threat landscape. New subscribers receive comprehensive onboarding tailored to their technical environments and staffing levels within weeks to get them up and running. The Office of Information Security is the primary oversight body for state entities and provides direct support to help executive branch organizations strengthen their cybersecurity and become more resilient, said State Chief Information Security Officer Vitaliy Panych. By offering shared services, we help entities detect, prevent, and respond to threats more quickly and effectively within a common framework. Our strategic intent with providing operational services is to govern each organization individually and uplift their ability to withstand threat activity under a unified approach. SOCaaS is flexible: partners can choose how much hands-on they want to retain by managing their own data flows or they can hand off the work entirely to the seasoned OIS team. Through regular health checks, key performance tracking, and personalized support subscribers stay protected and informed. Today, SOCaaS protects 112 public sector organizationsstate departments, counties, cities, school districts and special districtsand that number is growing without a need to increase OIS staffing. The cost to each participant is effectively zero with a combined estimated savings to the state exceeding 54 million. Thanks in great part to this amazing service, California didnt just raise the cybersecurity barit redefined it. To learn more about SOCaaS, contact CDTs Office of Information Security.

CISA California,https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/securing-core-cloud-identity-infrastructure-addressing-advanced-threats-through-public-private,Securing Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration  CISA,"Blog Securing Core Cloud Identity Infrastructure: Addressing Advanced Threats through Public-Private Collaboration ReleasedJuly 15, 2025 By Clayton Romans, Associate Director, Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative Related topics: Organizations and Cyber Safety, Cybersecurity Best Practices In recent years, the cloud landscape has faced increasingly sophisticated threat activity targeting identity and authentication systems. As cloud infrastructure has become more ubiquitousunderpinning key government and critical infrastructure datasophisticated nation-state affiliated actors have exposed limitations in token authentication, key management, logging mechanisms, third-party dependencies, and governance practices. These threats reaffirm the critical role that public-private collaboration plays to safeguard cloud infrastructure and address the evolving technical and security challenges confronting our nation. Challenges in Cloud Identity Security Cloud providers implement measures to secure cloud identity systems with varying degrees of robustness against security threats. Review of recent cloud security incidents demonstrates threat actors are increasingly exploiting vulnerabilities, forging tokens, and using stolen credentials to compromise organizational infrastructure. To mitigate these risks, cloud service providers can further harden authentication and authorization mechanisms, prioritizing improvements in token technology, secrets management, access control, logging, and forensic capabilities. Uplifting security practices in these areas present complex challenges, including: Token Validation Technology: Token management is pivotal to security. Stateless tokens are particularly vulnerable, as the compromise of signing keys can lead to widespread token forgery. While stateful token validation and token binding with proof of possession offer stronger security, system complexity and integration costs hinder their adoption.Secrets Management Systems: Scaling centralized secrets management systems risks misconfiguration and inconsistent policies. Secure key storage, like hardware security modules, faces access restrictions and performance trade-offs. Properly managed secrets rotation and optimized frequency are vital for security and continuity.Logging Practices: Limited telemetry and short log retention impede detection of forged tokens, compromised keys, and unauthorized token generation. Balancing consumer visibility with manageable log volumes is challenging, while inconsistent logging standards across providers hinder threat detection and response. Driving Public-Private Partnership to Fortify Infrastructure at Scale To address these challenges, CISAs Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) is working side-by-side with cloud service providers to foster discovery and discussion of best practices for strengthening cloud identity security. Together, we are exploring innovative solutions, including approaches to better protect tokens to prevent validation errors and forgery, improved secrets management for consistent encryption and access control, and enhanced logging to better detect malicious behavior. On June 25, CISA hosted the JCDC Cloud Identity Security Technical Exchange, gathering approximately 50 experts across the U.S. federal government and top cloud providers to analyze core cloud identity security practices, including individuals from: AWSGoogle CloudHashiCorpIBMMicrosoftOktaOracleWizThe OpenID FoundationNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)National Security Agency (NSA) The goal was to promote knowledge transfer across these organizations and to discuss approaches to harden cloud identity infrastructure at scale. The exchange focused on technical insights, operational experiences, and candid perspectives grounded in real-world situations. Insights gleaned from this exchange laid the foundation on how we can work together to improve the adoption of essential cloud identity security practices and enhance the resilience of critical cloud infrastructure. Public-private operational collaboration like this remains critical to the nations collective defense. Through JCDC, CISA continues to deepen trust across our closest and most capable partners, sharpening our respective cyber defense capabilities while increasing our reciprocal value to each other. We are learning and evolving our shared approaches quickly to stay ahead of our adversaries and enhance both real-time incident management and overall resiliency of the ecosystem. For example, CISA will leverage this technical exchange to provide actionable and threat-informed implementation guidance for the broader cloud community and inform future industry standards and guidelines in partnership with NIST and NSA. This partnership also supports CISA in reducing risk across the federal enterprise through more secure access and use of cloud environments and services. Securing cloud identity infrastructure is a strategic priority for CISA. We are committed to the public-private collaboration that is essential to countering the significant threats facing critical infrastructure. Together, we can build a more resilient cloud security ecosystem that protects our nations critical infrastructure from advanced threats. We look forward to working with partners to strengthen our defenses by further identifying systemic risks to cloud infrastructure, implementing best practices, and developing guidance for addressing emerging cloud-related threats.DisclaimerCISA does not endorse any commercial entity, product, company, or service, including any entities, products, or services referenced or linked to on this page.

Malicious cyber actors are targeting K12 education organizations across the country, with potentially catastrophic impacts on students, their families, teachers, and administrators. A new report from the CISA helps schools reduce the risks of a cyber catastrophe.There is no more important institution to the future prosperity and strength of the United States than our nations K12 education system.K12 schools and school districts have increasingly adopted advanced networking technologies that facilitate learning and make schools more efficient and effective. This technological gain, however, has introduced heightened risks.Protecting Our Future: Partnering to Safeguard K-12 Organizations from Cybersecurity reports on cybersecurity risks facing elementary and secondary schools and provides recommendations that include cybersecurity guidelines designed to help schools face these risks.CISA remains committed to working with its federal, state, local and territorial partners, and directly with the K-12 community to provide expertise, guidance and resources across the preparedness continuum that will strengthen safety and security of schools across the country. The CISA Resources and DHS Grants document provides information on grants, tools, resources available to the K-12 academic community. The Report and Media Kit This report covers cybersecurity risks facing elementary and secondary schools and provides recommendations that include cybersecurity guidelines designed to help schools face these risks. View Report and Media Kit Recommendations for K-12 Organizations1. Invest in the most impactful security measures and build toward a mature cybersecurity plan.In an environment of limited resources, leaders should leverage security investments to focus on the most impactful steps. Begin with a small number of prioritized investments:Deploy multifactor authenticationMitigate known exploited vulnerabilitiesImplement and test backupsRegularly exercise an incident response planImplement a strong cybersecurity training programIn the near-term, K12 entities should progress to adopting further investments in alignment with the full list of CISAs Cybersecurity Performance Goals. Over the long-term, K-12 entities should mature to build an enterprise cybersecurity plan that leverages the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.2. Recognize and actively address resource constraints.Most school districts are doing a lot with a little. There is a clear need for increased cybersecurity budgeting and support mechanisms across the community. This resource shortfall is a major constraint to implementing effective cybersecurity programs across all K-12 entities. CISA recommends that K-12 organizations take these key steps: Utilize free or low-cost services to make near-term improvements in resource-constrained environments.Expect and call for technology providers to enable strong security controls by default for no additional charge.Minimize the burden of security by migrating IT services to more secure cloud versions.3. Focus on collaboration and information sharing.K-12 entities struggle to fund cybersecurity resources while combating continuous threats. Situational awareness of changes in the risk environment is critical to ensure that resources are allocated to the most effective security mitigations and controls. CISA recommends that K-12 organizations take these key steps:Join relevant collaboration groups, such as MS-ISAC and K12 SIX.Work with other information-sharing organizations, such as fusion centers, state school safety centers, other state and regional agencies, and associations.Build a strong and enduring relationship with CISA and FBI regional cybersecurity personnel.How CISA is Working with K-12Cyberattacks, and the threat thereof, has strained resources and impacted delivery of critical education services across the nation. This has placed an untenable burden on our educational institutions and the populations that they serve and protect  children, parents, and educators. A continuing drumbeat of cyber intrusions is threatening the nations ability to educate our children while also placing personal information and school data at risk.Congress recognized this heightened risk environment by enacting the K12 Cybersecurity Act of 2021 (The Act), which required CISA to report on cybersecurity risks facing elementary and secondary schools and develop recommendations that include cybersecurity guidelines designed to help schools face these risks.Protecting Our Future: Partnering to Safeguard K-12 Organizations from Cybersecurity provides insight into the current threat landscape and the K12 communitys capacity to prevent and mitigate cyberattacks.Recommendations throughout this report are informed by insights from policymakers, government officials, and members of the K12 community. These recommendations are presented with a caveat: change must come from the top down. Leaders must establish and reinforce a cybersecure culture. Information technology and cybersecurity personnel cannot bear the burden alone.This report is only a starting point. CISA will continue to engage with federal partners, including the U.S. Department of Education, and work closely with state and local officials, school leaders, emergency management officials, nonprofits, community leaders, and the private sector to identify areas for progress and provide meaningful support that measurably reduces risk.How To Report K-12 Cyber IncidentsEvery K-12 organizationlarge and smallmust be prepared to respond to disruptive cyber incidents. CISA stands ready to help you prepare for, respond to, and mitigate the impact of cyberattacks.When cyber incidents are reported quickly, we can use this information to render assistance and as warning to prevent other organizations and entities from falling victim to a similar attack. CISA encourages our stakeholders to voluntarily share information about cyber-related events that could help mitigate current or emerging cybersecurity threats to critical infrastructure.
